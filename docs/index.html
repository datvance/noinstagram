            It’s a new day, and so many of us have lots of questions in these dynamic times. Eldora’s staff are all skiers—alpine, uphill, Nordic—and snowboarders at heart, and we understand how this impacts our staff, our community, and our guests. The decision to suspend operations and to abide by our Governor’s executive order was not made lightly.

Our staff is the lifeblood of Eldora and that is why all of our scheduled employees, both seasonal and year-round, will be paid for their scheduled regular hours now through March 22, without needing to use any vacation or sick time. During this time, certain employees will be on resort or working remotely for specific operations and resort needs. All staff received this news first via internal emails or calls from managers and directors prior to any external communications.

Given the extenuating circumstances related to COVID-19, we have modified our cancellation policies and our Eldora guest services team will be available to help our guests make adjustments. Our ability to respond will be limited this week, and due to heavy volume, we ask for your patience as we work through inquiries. Please email us at info@eldora.com with any questions.

Uphill travel is closed until further notice. The short answer to “why” is for the safety of our staff and guests. Things are changing rapidly for us right now. We are still going to have safety and control work going on and equipment like snowcats and snowmobiles that will be active around the mountain. This is not like a planned end-of-season closure. We have a lot of things to work through and take care of and we would very much appreciate everyone’s cooperation by observing the full closure until the situation is clearer. In the meantime, there are plenty of public-lands trailheads around the Front Range where uphillers can enjoy fresh air (just remember to bring your backcountry skills and safety equipment with you). We appreciate working together as a community. Let’s continue to work together and be adaptable and compassionate and we’ll get through this.

            We would like to thank our guests for your patience and understanding with the decision to suspend on-mountain operations effective today, March 15. Understandably, we have received many questions regarding refunds/credit, if we will be re-opening, and if we will be allowing uphill access, and others. 
While downhill skiing will not be available, select Village locations and base services will still be open for the time being. Guests with lodging reservations are still welcome to visit if they choose to.  We are working through what select services will remain available in the coming weeks, and working with our community to provide the best experiences for guests and support local businesses. We will provide a list of services and activities available as we have more information.
Because of high call volume, please email reservations@winterparkresort.com  for refunds or credit. We ask for your patience as we work as quickly as possible to process all refunds or credits.  We are working through details regarding unused Four Pack days, season passes, lesson multi-packs, and other products. We will provide updated information when available. 
For now, we will be permitting uphill access on limited terrain. Please follow our end-of-season policy and stay on Lower Hughes, Hughes, Norwegian, and Little Pierre in the Winter Park Territory and Sleeper in the Mary Jane Territory. Medical and patrol services will not be provided. Please be aware that there will not be any avalanche mitigation as well. 
The decision to suspend on-mountain operations was made through a directive from our parent company, Alterra Mountain Company and an executive order from Colorado Governor Jared Polis. We will continue to evaluate our operations for the health and safety of our guests and employees as COVID-19 evolves and make decisions about future operations based on guidance from the Governor, Alterra, and health officials. 
Thank you for your continued passion for the mountains we all love, and we will continue to work through this together. We will share further updates here as they become available.

            At Eldora, our top priority is the health and safety of our staff, guests, and local community. For this reason, Eldora will, consistent with Governor Polis’s Executive Order, suspend all resort operations starting tomorrow, March 15, 2020, through March 22, 2020. We will continue to monitor the dynamic COVID-19 situation and reassess our approach for the rest of the season during this timeframe.

The suspension will include all lift operations, food and beverage, ski and ride school, retail and rental services, as well as all alpine, Nordic, and uphill skiing.

From those of us at Eldora who love to live the adventure lifestyle, to those of you who share our passion, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this short notice will undoubtedly create. We look forward to welcoming you back to the mountain as circumstances improve.

All operations will be closed with limited exceptions. Lodging will remain open in limited capacity to provide services for those who are here.

We will work directly with our guests in canceling their visit and will provide refunds to those who have hotel and other bookings during this closure period.

            Eldora remains open, and we are committed to operating in ways that responsibly take into consideration the needs of our staff and guests. We are doing so because we believe it’s good for the soul to live and enjoy the adventure lifestyle—and this is particularly the case right now. So c’mon up, but remember to bump those fists/elbows/feet, keep that  wash your hands, and STAY HOME if you’re not feeling well.

As a precautionary measure, we’ve decided to cancel our free weekend RTD bus ticket giveaways as well as our free weekend Justice Center shuttles through the end of the season. We’ve also decided to cancel all events and live music through the end of March, including Subaru Winterfest, which had been scheduled for March 27–29.

Thanks for your cooperation and understanding. We’ll get through this together, with a little help from one another. In the meantime, stay safe, breath that fresh mountain air, and enjoy those wide-open spaces we all love so much.

            3/14 Update: Winter Park has suspended operations until further notice. Please see our latest social post for more information.

Update: While Winter Park Resort remains open, we’re continuing to take precautions in the best interest of our guests, employees and partners. Based on Colorado Governor Jared Polis’s March 13 comments, Winter Park is canceling all public events of 250 people or more until further notice. We want to ensure our guests continue to feel comfortable enjoying skiing and riding on our mountain and resort.

The health and safety of our guests is our top priority at Winter Park. Out of an abundance of caution, we have made the decision to cancel Fireworks & Family Fest on 3/14. We want to ensure our guests continue to feel comfortable enjoying skiing and riding on our mountain and within our resort. We are open for business and our planned closing date remains April 26, 2020 for the Winter Park base. We will continue to take proactive measures to provide our guests and employees an enjoyable experience in the mountains we all love.

            Well...that certainly wasn’t the satisfying ending to the racing season that any of us had been dreaming of! But in my 16 hours spent in Quebec before our last races were canceled, I got a chance to see most of our team. We talked, we laughed, and I was once again reminded that this sport has always been about the people, the emotions and the connections, more than it’s been about races or results. Luckily, all these amazing people are in our lives even (and especially) through tough and unpredictable times! ❤️ Happy spring everyone, and a special thank you to my sponsors and team for all the support and cheering through another exciting year. 🙏🏼💙 📷: @nordicfocus

            Eldora will not open today, Thursday, March 12, 2020, due to high winds, power outages, and safety concerns. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for understanding. It may be windy, but the sunrise sure was beautiful. Groomer Scott Beardslee captured this shot from the cab of his snowcat earlier today 🌄

            Heartbroken to announce that as of very early this morning, the MN World Cup and Fastenal Parallel 45 Festival has been cancelled due to the rapid escalation of the COVID-19 virus. This decision was not made lightly, but it was made appropriately in real time by all organizing parties involved in order to keep everyone safe.

To all the organizers, sponsors, volunteers, athletes and every single fan that was excited to rev up their cowbells; I see you, I hear you, and I want you to know that the event being cancelled in no way diminishes the excitement and joy that your love for sport has created.  Your belief and hard work has not gone unnoticed and it has made a difference, with or without the start gun going off. The fact that we were ready to race in the US has created so many opportunities for growth in sport, and we will pick up the pieces and move forward with hope that we will get another chance. Thank you for your love and cheering, that means everything to our team! 📷: Skinnyski

            There’s only 6 World Cup races left this season! And we wouldn’t have made it this far without the unwavering support of our inspiring, hardworking and caring staff. We are so lucky to have volunteer Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and Doctors who travel with us and keep us healthy and ready to rock and roll. Then of course we have our Coaches and Techs, working tirelessly behind the scenes and always ready with a smile! These women and men take time away from their families to help us pursue the craziest dreams, and their hard work makes a huge difference! So thank you to our staff, I’m excited to finish this season with you. 🙏🏼💛 📷: @martinriseth & @usskiteam

            HAVEN’T SEEN DARK MATTER YET!? Well you're in luck, @curtismorgan and I just launched it for free on Amazon Prime! [link in bio]
.
This line basically sums up why I snowboard. Also, why so many challenges of riding big mountain backcountry can feel so completely worth it when conditions line up! This line I’m calling Gary, as it is a part of the Wizard face and @marklandvik was the first to ever ride it. To my knowledge he was also the last! If you know Mark, well you know why it’s called GARY... @codytownsend did you guys get this spine? Shot on @GoPro at Tordrillo Mountain Lodge [@tordrilloheli] and presented by @Quiksilver, @HempFusion, and @BoaFitSystem.

            The new  fire engine was inaugurated into service over the weekend with a Push-In Ceremony. This honors a long-standing fire service tradition dating back to the 1800s when fire departments used hand-drawn pumpers and horse-drawn equipment. Upon returning to the station after a fire call, the horses could not easily back the equipment into the station. So they were disconnected from the fire equipment and firefighters would push the equipment back into the bays themselves. Today, the ceremony signifies retiring an old engine and putting a new engine into service.
